<h2>Important Information</h2>
<h3>4.1 Age Requirement</h3>
<div>
    You have to meet Assistance's minimum age requirement of 14 to create an Assistance Account. If you are under the age of 14 you must have a cosigner of 25 years or older to act as guardian over your account. During account creation you will be prompted to select the account of an individual over the age of 25 to be your cosigner and will have to wait until that individual accepts or declines this responsibility. The cosigner will be legally responsible for actions taken by the minor during their use of Assistance as well as during physical and virtual service and service request activity outside of assistance. The cosigner is also legally responsible to the parents or legal guardian of the minor. Cosigners can be switched but all minors must have a cosigner in order to have an active assistance account until they are 18 years or age.

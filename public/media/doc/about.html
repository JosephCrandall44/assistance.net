<h2>Providing Services</h2>

    Users can provide service in one of two ways. A user can provide a service by creating a service listing and waiting for other users to select their service. A user can also respond to a request for a service by looking through service requests and bidding to provide that user a service.

<h2>Requesting Services</h2>

    Users looking for service can attain them through two methods. A user can look through service providers and purchase one of their services. A user can also create a request for a service and wait for users to come to them to provide them that service.

    As a user creates and provides services, whether they be unique or repeats of prior services, they will develop an Assistance reputation. Depending on reviews, they will be promoted accordingly on the site, coming up more frequently in searches pertaining to their specific services as they are validated for effectively providing different skills. Users have the opportunity to upload their certifications, diplomas, licenses, or other forms of skill verification.

<h2>Payment System</h2>

    All users receiving or depositing payments and written reviews need to have an account. The secure account system will require users to add basic personal information and a payment method.  Those offering services can customize their profiles by indicating their level of education, experience in their field, reviews from past clients, and much more. The commission assistance takes from the final sale is determined by three factors, the cumulative reviews from the user, the cost of the service, and the frequency of service provision. The scale has a ceiling of ten percent but will always be greater than zero.

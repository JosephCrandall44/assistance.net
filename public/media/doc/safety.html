<title>Safety Information</title>
<h3 style="padding-top: 0">Stay Vigilant</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stay vigilant - never give out your sensitive information if you feel something isn't right.</li>
    <li>Have a general level of caution when approaching all email messages and websites.</li>
    <li>Email isn't a very secure channel to send sensitive information back and forth, so it's a good practice not to do so. It's much better to go directly to the page or website, if you have an existing relationship with the individual or company, and enter your information from there.</li>
    <li>When entering personal information on a website, it's also a good idea to check the browser bar for a secure connection. If you see https:// in the browser's address bar, it's a good indication the connection is protected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strong Password</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Don't use the same password for all the sites you visit.</li>
    <li>Don't use a word from the dictionary.</li>
    <li>Select strong passwords that can't easily be guessed with 10 or more characters.</li>
    <li>Think of a meaningful phrase, song, or quote and turn it into a complex password using the first letter of each word.</li>
</ul>

As Service providers increase the amount customers are willing to pay, and the quantity they are willing to buy, the commission decreases. Transversely, if the service provider cuts their service costs in order to being in more clients, the service provider pays a higher commission as a penalty for the service providers' deflation of that particular market. The service providers who charges the lowest and produces the fewest services in their markets pay up to a 10% commission, versus the most successful service providres who charge the highest prices and produce the most services in their market pay commissions as low as 3%.",

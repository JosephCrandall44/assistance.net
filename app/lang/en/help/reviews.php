The review asks the user to give a rating on a scale of one star to five stars (one being the worst and five being the best) on the quality of the service and how effectively thier time and money was spent. This ensures that not only are all reviews based upon monetary transactions, but they can be traced by other users in order to understand who is validating the service providersâ€™ work. Along with contributing reviews, service consumers can validate the skills their service provider has displayed.',
